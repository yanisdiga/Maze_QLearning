# ðŸ§  Intelligent Maze with Q-Learning

A randomly generated maze project where an AI agent learns to find the exit using the Q-Learning algorithm. This includes an interactive Pygame GUI to visualize the training process and the optimal path discovered.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- **Random maze generation** with a designated start and exit.
- **Q-Learning Agent implementation** to solve the maze autonomously.
- **Visualization of the optimal path** (in blue) and the agent's current position (in red).
- **Interactive GUI** with manual or automatic controls.
- **Real-time training** with adjustable hyperparameters (epsilon, gamma, alpha).
